  "1": "I'm the atom, the small unit that forms all matter around you and preserves the properties of every element. I am the fundamental building block of the universe.",
  "2": "I am extremely small and invisible, so you can't see me with your eye, but you know what's the interesting part? I can be divided into smaller parts! My center includes a nucleus containing two types of particles: positively charged protons (+p), discovered by Ernest Rutherford, which define what the element is, neutral neutrons (n), discovered by James Chadwick, and electrons (-e), discovered by J.J. Thomson, that move in regions around me called energy levels, carrying a negative charge.",
  "3": "The atomic number is the total number of protons found in an atom's nucleus. It determines the identity of the element, for me my atomic number is 6. This identifies me as carbon, an element that can form strong bonds and create a variety of compounds, making me essential for life.",
  "4": " We belong to large families called elements. Each chemical element represents a different type of atom. Take me as an example: I am a carbon atom, which means my element is carbon!",
  "5": "The mass number is the sum of protons and neutrons inside the atom’s nucleus. It helps show the size of the atom compared with other atoms of the same element.",
  "6": "Isotopes are atoms of the same element that differ in the number of neutrons in their nuclei. For instance, I exist as three isotopes: Carbon-12, Carbon-13, and Carbon-14. Yet, I remain carbon, always keeping my identity and chemical properties as the same element.",
  "7": "Normally, I prefer to have the same number of electrons as protons. For example, with my 6 protons, I feel stable with 6 electrons. Most atoms behave the same way, but sometimes they are not electrically neutral and become ions. A positive ion forms when an atom loses an electron, while a negative ion forms when it gains one.",
  "8": "The periodic table is my home and the home of many atomic families. We are more than 118 elements, organized according to our atomic numbers. In this table, we are arranged in horizontal rows called periods, each row showing our energy levels. We also belong to vertical groups, where we share similar chemical properties. It is called periodic because these patterns of properties repeat from one period to the next.",
  "9": "Well, my curious scientist, let me tell you about an amazing invention that allows you to see me! It’s called the Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM). Just like you need a microscope to see cells in biology, the STM lets you study atoms. It works by using a sharp metal tip and a phenomenon known as quantum tunneling, which allows electrons to pass through the tiny space between the tip and the atom’s surface. This creates a detailed image of individual atoms.",
  "10": "Electrons in an atom occupy regions called energy levels. Each level, represented by n, can hold a specific number of electrons calculated using the formula e = 2n².",
  "11": "Sublevels are divisions within each main energy level of an atom that describe the shape and energy of orbitals where electrons can be found. Each energy level contains a certain number of sublevels, and these sublevels are named s, p, d, and f. The s sublevel has one orbital and can hold two electrons, the p sublevel has three orbitals and can hold six electrons, the d sublevel has five orbitals and can hold ten electrons, and the f sublevel has seven orbitals and can hold fourteen electrons. Electrons fill these orbitals following the Aufbau principle, starting with the lowest-energy orbitals first, which ensures they occupy the most stable arrangement around the nucleus.",
"12": "The first person to propose the idea of atoms was the Greek philosopher Democritus in the fifth century BC. He suggested that everything is made of tiny, indivisible, and indestructible particles, which he called “Atomos”, meaning “indivisible” in Greek. However, his ideas were based on philosophical reasoning rather than scientific experiments. Today, our understanding of atoms is very different. Science has shown that an atom is divisible and made up of smaller particles, such as protons, neutrons, and electrons. Despite the simplicity of Democritus’ idea and the criticism it faced from other philosophers, it laid the foundation for later scientists to develop their theories, leading to the discovery of the atom and many experiments. Among the most important were the experiments of John Dalton, which marked the beginning of the modern atomic theory.",
  "13" :"The ionic bond is a very interesting type of bond that forms between two ions with opposite charges. It occurs when one atom loses an electron and becomes a positively charged ion, while another atom gains an electron and becomes a negatively charged ion. This type of bond usually happens between metals and nonmetals, because metals tend to lose electrons and nonmetals tend to gain them. The resulting electrostatic attraction between the positively and negatively charged ions holds them together.",
  "14": "A covalent bond is a type of chemical bond that involves the sharing of electrons between atoms to form electron pairs, much like building a strong connection. These shared pairs of electrons are called shared pairs or bonding pairs, and they hold the atoms together within a molecule.",
  "15": "Chemical reactions can be classified into four main types, although some reactions may fall into more than one category. First, there is the synthesis reaction, in which two or more substances combine to form a single new substance. Next is the combustion reaction, which occurs when a substance reacts with oxygen, releasing energy in the form of heat and light. Then comes the decomposition reaction, which is the opposite of synthesis, as a single compound breaks down into two or more elements or new compounds. Finally, there is the replacement reaction, which includes two subtypes: single replacement, where atoms of one element replace atoms of another in a compound, and double replacement, where ions are exchanged between two compounds. These reactions usually occur in aqueous solutions.",
  "16": "It is impossible for substances to completely disappear in a chemical reaction; they only change from one form to another, such as compounds, gases, or precipitates. According to the law of conservation of mass, mass cannot be created or destroyed, meaning the total amount of matter remains the same before and after the reaction. The chemical reaction can only rearrange the atoms to form new substances.",
  "17": "I can, but it’s not easy! To become an atom of another element, the number of protons in my nucleus must change, which does not happen in ordinary chemical reactions. This only occurs in a nuclear reaction, where the nucleus itself changes. In such reactions, my identity completely changes from one element to another. This usually happens when I have an unstable nucleus, meaning my nucleus contains an imbalanced number of protons and neutrons. After all, I am defined by my number of protons… and if that changes, so do I!",
"18": "Because of quantum mechanics. My electrons occupy quantized energy states, and the lowest possible energy (ground state) is still higher than the energy they would have if they were inside the nucleus. According to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, trying to confine an electron to the tiny space of the nucleus would require an impossible amount of momentum and energy. Additionally, electrons behave like standing waves, and only certain wave patterns(orbitals)are allowed. This combination of quantized energy, wave behavior, and the uncertainty principle ensures that my electrons move freely within their clouds but remain stable around me, never collapsing into my nucleus.",
  "19": "Noble gases are chemical elements in Group 18 of the periodic table. They are very stable and unreactive because their outer electron shells are full. Examples include helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon, and radon.",
  "20": "Valence electrons are the electrons in the outermost energy level of an atom. They determine how an atom reacts chemically and forms bonds with other atoms. For example, I have 4 valence electrons, which allow me to form covalent bonds with other elements.",
